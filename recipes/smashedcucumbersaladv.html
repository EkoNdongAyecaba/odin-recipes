    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My zaida (grandfather), named Arnold, was a natural host. Every time we went to his house, he would come in with a tray of candies, Mrs. Fields cookies, Coke, and ice cream floats (with unique flavor combinations, like cream soda or orange soda in place of cola, no less). He made freshly squeezed orange juice for my bubbe (grandmother) every morning, and if you were lucky, he would make you a batch of “Zaida’s Pickles,” made with pickling cucumbers, salt, sugar, and vinegar. It was a perfectly tangy treat that we looked forward to and craved every summer. Since then, I often make my own pickle variations and think of how he took such pride in caring for others. The flavors of Arnie’s pickles inspired me to create this cucumber salad, a modern twist of a side dish that is a hybrid between a salad and a plate of his pickles. It’s a great dinner party option.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large English cucumbers or 6 Persian cucumbers</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh dill</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the cucumbers:</h3>
            <p>Cut the ends off the cucumbers and cut them in half lengthwise. Place the cucumber halves, cut side down, on a cutting board and, using the handle of a wooden spoon or spatula, press down firmly using the heel of your hand until the cucumber splits, repeating the motion along the length of the cucumber. Once it is evenly smashed, cut the cucumbers into diagonal 1-inch slices.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Salt the cucumbers:</h3>
            <p>Transfer the cucumbers to a large bowl, add the salt, toss until combined, and let sit for 20 minutes. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Dress the cucumbers:</h3>
            <p>Using a colander, drain the excess liquid from the cucumbers, and then return them to the bowl. Add the vinegar, sugar, and garlic, toss, and let sit for 10 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Add herbs and serve:</h3>
            <p>Add the dill and mix until combined. Taste, season with salt and pepper, and serve.</p>
